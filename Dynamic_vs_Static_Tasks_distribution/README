Brief:
Given code that runs with a double loop the "heavy" function add add all and the results together by,
(The function heavy is very heavy on the computer and takes time to perform).
In this project  divided the task into smaller tasks and divided them between different amount of processes working in parallel.

The division of tasks between the processes took place in 2 different ways -
1. Statically, wich each process got several tasks to perform beforahaed.
2. Dynamically when each process received a task as soon as it was free.

The Project contain 3 small projects:
1. Static - Contain the static task division.
2. Dynamic - Contain the dynamic task division. 
3. Sequential - the code  with out paraller processes.

Running instructions: 
By using Ubuntu terminal :
1. mpicc <Cfile name> -lm -o <binary executable name>
2. mpiexec -np <number of processes> <binary executable name>

(For Sequential number of processes have to be 1).
